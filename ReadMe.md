   - Digital preservation is like a three legged stool
      - Originally from Nancy McGovern
      - Renowned Achivist

   - Leg one:   Technology
   - Leg two:   Organization

   - Technology leg is solidified at SP
   - Lack of taken up of the capacility of DP facility by researchers
   - The other two legs wobble
   - Call for policies, strategies, procedures and staff resources to expedite the uptake of the DP infrastructure.
